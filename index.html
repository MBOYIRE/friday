        <p> The reason why I decide to take a class of programming is that: I like to encrease my skills in everything if possible especially in technology.</P>
        <p>I know I'm weak about it but I believe myself that I can do everything when I put into my plan,</p>
        <P>so,I was interested in this coding program and I took it as an opportunity I got .</p>
